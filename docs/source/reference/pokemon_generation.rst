|Pokemon| Generation
####################

|Pokemon| are complex creatures. There are dozens of ways they can be customized and configured for battling or spawning.

|Pokemon| can be generated using **generation strings**, which are a series of options separated by semicolons. For instance, :code:`pikachu;level 25;male` would generate a mal, level 25 Pikachu. If given to the :jcoad:trigger:`battle` trigger, a battle with this wild |Pokemon| would be initiated. If given to the :jcoad:trigger:`mon` trigger, the |Pokemon| would be given directly to the player.

These strings are also used in the battle simulator.

|Pokemon| Identification
============================

The first option in the generation string should be an identification string. This string identifies the exact |Pokemon|, stored in some Dex on |Pokengine|, that should be generated. The format is:

.. code-block::

    pokemon,pokedex,form

Here are some simple examples:

    :code:`pikachu` |emdash| No Dex given, so uses the lowest ID first (Nintendo, not Aristos).

    :code:`pikachu,nintendo` |emdash| Explicitly uses Pikachu from the Nintendo Dex.

    :code:`pikachu,aristos` |emdash| Explicitly uses Pikachu from the Aristos Dex.

    :code:`25,1,0` |emdash| Dev ID for Pikachu from the Nintendo Dex.

    :code:`57,46,0` |emdash| Dev ID for Pikachu from the Aristos Dex.

If you are unsure what string to use, hover over a |Pokemon|'s dex number on its Dex page, and use the "Dev ID."

The following options can be placed after the identification string, in any order. All options should be separated by semicolons.

.. jcoad:pokeoption:: uid

    Set the |Pokemon|'s caught data. Caught strings are another type of string that must be formatted. Every option must appear continuously.

    :code:`by[player_id]` |emdash| Set the player who caught the |Pokemon|

    :code:`in[item_id]` |emdash| Set the Pok√©Ball the |Pokemon| was caught in

    :code:`on[map_id]` |emdash| Set where the |Pokemon| was caught

Here is a complex example of a |Pokemon| generation string:

    .. code-block::

        pikachu,aristos;level 25;male;shiny;name PikaPika;moves 344,231,85,98;item everstone;caught in16

This string represents a Pikachu from the Aristos Dex. It is male, level 25, and shiny. It is named "PikaPika." It has the moves Volt Tackle, Iron Tail, Thunderbolt, and Quick Attack. It is holding an everstone, and it is caught in a Cherish Ball.
